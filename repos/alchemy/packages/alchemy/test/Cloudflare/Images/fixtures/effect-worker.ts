/**
 * Effect-native Worker fixture for the Cloudflare Images binding. Yielding
 * `Cloudflare.Images.Images(...)` during Init attaches the binding to this Worker and
 * returns the runtime client in one step — no separate `.bind(...)`. The
 * worker forwards the request body (typed as `Stream.Stream<Uint8Array>`)
 * straight into `images.info(...)`, proving the Effect-native client converts
 * an Effect Stream into the runtime ReadableStream the binding expects.
