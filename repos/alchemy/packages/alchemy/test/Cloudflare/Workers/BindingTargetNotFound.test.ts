/**
 * Deploy-time binding validation rejects a script upload whose bindings
 * reference a resource that doesn't exist. The Durable Object
 * cross-script binding is the one deterministic engine-level trigger:
 * `scriptName` is a plain string, so a stack can name a script that was
 * never deployed. (Every other binding type can only reference a
 * resource declared in the stack, and its reconciler heals a missing
 * target before the Worker deploys — those hit not-found only via
 * propagation races, which `putWorkerScript`'s bounded retry rides
 * out.)
 *
 * The deploy must fail with the resource-specific typed error after the
 * bounded retry exhausts — not an UnknownCloudflareError, and not a
 * success.
