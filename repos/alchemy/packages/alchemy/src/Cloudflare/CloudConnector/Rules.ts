/**
 * The ordered list of Cloud Connector rules for a Cloudflare zone.
 *
 * Cloud Connector routes matching traffic directly from Cloudflare's edge
 * to a cloud-provider object-storage bucket (Cloudflare R2, Amazon S3,
 * Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage) without an origin server.
 * Each rule pairs a Rules-language expression with the target bucket host.
 *
 * The zone has exactly one rule list — the API only supports replacing the
 * whole list — so this resource owns it in its entirety (PUT-replace
 * semantics) and there should be at most one `Rules`
 * resource per zone. Destroying the resource clears the list.
 *
 * Safety: when there is no prior state and the zone already has a
 * non-empty rule list, `read` reports it as `Unowned` and the engine
 * refuses to take it over unless `--adopt` (or `adopt(true)`) is set.
 *
 * Note: Cloud Connector only takes effect on proxied (orange-cloud) DNS
 * records, and the number of rules per zone is plan-limited.

 * @example Serve a path prefix from an S3 bucket
 * ```typescript
 * yield* Cloudflare.CloudConnector.Rules("Rules", {
 *   zoneId: zone.zoneId,
 *   rules: [
 *     {
 *       provider: "aws_s3",

 *   ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example Serve static assets from an R2 bucket
 * ```typescript
 * const bucket = yield* Cloudflare.R2.Bucket("Assets", {});
 *
 * yield* Cloudflare.CloudConnector.Rules("Rules", {
 *   zoneId: zone.zoneId,
