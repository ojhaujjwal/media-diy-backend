/**
 * A Magic Transit / Magic WAN endpoint healthcheck — a continuous ICMP

 * behind Magic tunnels.
 *
 * The `endpoint` must be a private (on-net) IP; Cloudflare rejects public
 * IPs with the typed `InvalidHealthcheckEndpoint` error. The `endpoint` is
 * mutable in place via PUT (the UUID is stable across updates), but `name`
 * is create-only — changing it triggers a replacement.
 * @resource
 * @product Diagnostics
 * @category Observability & Analytics
 * @section Creating an endpoint healthcheck
 * @example Probe an on-net host
 * ```typescript
 * const check = yield* Cloudflare.Diagnostics.EndpointHealthcheck("core-router", {
 *   endpoint: "10.0.0.1",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example With an explicit name
 * ```typescript
 * const check = yield* Cloudflare.Diagnostics.EndpointHealthcheck("core-router", {
 *   endpoint: "10.0.0.1",
 *   name: "core-router-probe",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @section Updating
 * @example Re-point the probe at a different host
 * ```typescript
 * // Changing `endpoint` updates the same healthcheck in place.
 * const check = yield* Cloudflare.Diagnostics.EndpointHealthcheck("core-router", {
 *   endpoint: "10.0.0.2",
