/**
 * An Action is a node in the dependency graph that runs an Effect with its
 * resolved input during {@link plan}/{@link apply}. It is similar to a
 * Resource but without a Provider lifecycle:
 *
 *   - It has a LogicalId and typed Input.
 *   - The body Effect is called when input changes (diff) or `--force` is set.
 *   - There is no replace/precreate/read/delete: removing an Action from the
 *     stack simply drops its persisted state without invoking the body.
 *   - Dependencies pulled in by the init Effect surface as `Req` on the
 *     call site, exactly like a Resource's provider services.
 *
 * Actions are recorded on {@link Stack.actions} and produce a single output
 * value; `yield*` on the constructor returns `Output<Out>` for use as
 * input to downstream Resources / Actions.
