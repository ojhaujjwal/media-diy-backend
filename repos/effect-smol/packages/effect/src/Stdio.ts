/**
 * Service contract for process standard input, output, error output, and
 * command-line arguments.
 *
 * `Stdio` lets command-line programs depend on standard I/O through the Effect
 * environment instead of reading from or writing to global process handles
 * directly. The service exposes arguments as an `Effect`, stdout and stderr as
 * `Sink`s that accept strings or bytes, and stdin as a byte `Stream`.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * Application code describes what it needs from standard I/O, and a runtime
 * layer supplies the concrete streams. Platform packages provide real process
 * implementations, while tests can use `Stdio.layerTest` to replace only the
 * fields that matter for a scenario and keep the rest inert.
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Read command-line arguments from the service's `args` effect.
 * - Write text or bytes by running values into the service's `stdout()` or
 *   `stderr()` sinks.
 * - Consume `stdin` as a stream of `Uint8Array` chunks.
 * - Build deterministic tests with `Stdio.layerTest`.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * Standard I/O is a platform capability. Reads and writes can fail with
 * `PlatformError`, so handle failures in the Effect error channel instead of
 * assuming the process streams are always available.
