/**
 * The `RunnerHealth` module defines the health-check service used by the
 * unstable cluster runtime when deciding whether a runner can keep ownership of
 * its assigned shards. The service answers whether a runner address is alive
 * enough for sharding to keep routing work to it.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * Runner health feeds placement decisions, not process supervision. A healthy
 * result lets the current runner continue serving its entities, while an
 * unhealthy result allows sharding to move those shards to another runner. Keep
 * checks conservative: a runner reported as unavailable may still be finishing
 * in-flight messages.
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Provide a custom {@link RunnerHealth} service for deployment-specific
 *   failure detection.
 * - Use {@link layerPing} to check runners through the cluster runner protocol.
 * - Use {@link layerK8s} when Kubernetes pod readiness should drive runner
 *   health.
 * - Use {@link layerNoop} in tests or single-runner environments where every
 *   runner should be treated as healthy.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - False negatives can trigger shard reassignment away from runners that are
 *   still processing messages.
 * - The Kubernetes implementation treats API failures as healthy to avoid
 *   reassignment caused by a temporary control-plane outage.
 * - {@link layerNoop} disables failure detection for this decision point, so it
 *   should only be used when that tradeoff is intentional.
 *
 * **See also**
 *
 * - {@link RunnerHealth}
 * - {@link layerPing}, {@link layerK8s}, and {@link layerNoop}
