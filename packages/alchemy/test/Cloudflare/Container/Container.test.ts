// nginx master aborts with `[emerg] could not open error log file` before it
// ever binds the port, so getTcpPort() can never connect. The fixtures work
// around this two ways: the `external` Dockerfile (which we own) replaces the
// log symlinks with real files, and the `remote` variant uses a server image
// (`mendhak/http-https-echo`) that writes to its inherited stdout fd directly
