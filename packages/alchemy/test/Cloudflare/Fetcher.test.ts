// A Cloudflare fetcher whose first `failures` `.fetch()` calls reject with the
// given message, then resolve with a 200 — models a Durable Object / service
// binding that is briefly mid-propagation after deploy (workerd routes to a
// stale script version that has no fetch handler yet).
//
// The retry lives in `fromCloudflareFetcher` — the single adapter every CF
// binding flows through — NOT in any one higher-level wrapper (`toHttpClient`,
// the RPC DO transport, etc.), because the "no fetch handler" window is a
// property of invoking the binding itself, so every consumer should be
// resilient to it without re-implementing the retry.
