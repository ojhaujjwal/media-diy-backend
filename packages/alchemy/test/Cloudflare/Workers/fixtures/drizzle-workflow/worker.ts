/**
 * Worker that hosts {@link DrizzleWorkflow} and exposes start/status routes so
 * the test can fire an instance and poll it to completion. The Hyperdrive
 * binding is declared inside the workflow (not here) and propagates onto this
 * worker's deployment config, mirroring how a Durable Object declares its own
 * bindings.
 *
 * The `/query/:id` route runs a Drizzle query directly in the fetch handler —
 * the isolate builds its layers once, and each event builds (and closes) its
 * own pool against its per-event scope. The test hammers it with sequential
 * and concurrent requests to pin the cross-request regression: no
 * "Cannot perform I/O on behalf of a different request", no
 * "Cannot use a pool after calling end on the pool".
