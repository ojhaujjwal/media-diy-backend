/**
 * The fast half of the Shutdown-phase contract: the generated entry
 * registers an internal extension with the Extensions API at cold start.
 * Registration is the documented precondition for Lambda's SIGTERM window —
 * without any registered extension the sandbox is killed with 0 ms and no
 * signal; with an internal extension the runtime gets SIGTERM + 500 ms.
 *
 * A successful invoke proves registration doesn't hang Init (a registered
 * extension must signal readiness via the parked `/event/next` long-poll —
 * getting that wrong wedges Init and every invoke 502s). Lambda logs the
 * registration as an `EXTENSION` platform line, which pins that the
 * registration was actually accepted.
 *
 * The slow half — Lambda delivering SIGTERM at idle spin-down and the
 * instance finalizers running — takes many idle minutes and is gated below.
