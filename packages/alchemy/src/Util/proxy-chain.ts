 * ```typescript
 * // Without proxyChain — caller has to yield the cached Effect first:
 * const conn = yield* makeConnection();      // Effect<Db>
 * fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const db = yield* conn;
 *   const rows = yield* db.select().from(users);

 *
 * // With proxyChain — caller treats the return as the value directly:
 * const db = proxyChain(yield* Effect.cached(makeDb));   // T
 * fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const rows = yield* db.select().from(users);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The chain ends when the proxy is yielded as an Effect — the resolved
 * value at that point must be a `Yieldable` (an Effect, drizzle query
 * builder, etc). Anything before that is recorded as ops.
