/**
 * A Cloudflare Durable Object namespace that manages globally unique, stateful
 * instances with WebSocket hibernation support.
 *
 * A Durable Object uses a two-phase pattern with two nested `Effect.gen`
 * blocks. The outer Effect resolves shared dependencies (other DOs,
 * containers, etc.) and the instance state *reference*
 * (`Cloudflare.DurableObjectState`). The inner Effect returns the
 * object's public methods and WebSocket handlers — and is the only
 * place the state's `RuntimeContext`-colored methods (`storage.get`,
 * `storage.put`, …) can actually run.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   // Phase 1: resolve shared dependencies + the instance state ref
 *   const db = yield* Cloudflare.D1.QueryDatabase(MyDatabase);
 *   const state = yield* Cloudflare.DurableObjectState;
 *
 *   return Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     // Phase 2: per-instance setup and public API. `state`'s methods
 *     // (storage.get/put, …) are RuntimeContext-colored, so the actual
 *     // I/O happens here, in the runtime closure.
 *     return {
 *       save: (data: string) => db.exec("INSERT ..."),
 *       fetch: Effect.gen(function* () { ... }),
 *       webSocketMessage: Effect.fn(function* (ws, msg) { ... }),
 *     };
 *   });
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * There are two ways to define a Durable Object. See the
 * [Functions & Servers](/infrastructure-as-effects/functions-and-servers) page
 * for the full explanation.
 *
 * - **Inline** — Effect implementation passed directly, single file.
 * - **Modular** — class and implementation in separate files for tree-shaking.
 *
 * @resource
 * @product Workers
 * @category Workers & Compute
 *
 * @section Inline Durable Objects
 * Pass the Effect implementation as the second argument. This is the
 * simplest approach — everything lives in one file. Convenient when
 * the DO doesn't need to be referenced by other Workers or DOs that
 * would pull in its runtime dependencies.
 *
 * @example Inline Durable Object
 * ```typescript
 * export default class Counter extends Cloudflare.DurableObject<Counter>()(
 *   "Counter",
 *   Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     // init: bind resources + resolve the instance state ref
 *     const db = yield* Cloudflare.D1.QueryDatabase(MyDatabase);
 *     const state = yield* Cloudflare.DurableObjectState;
 *
 *     return Effect.gen(function* () {
 *       // runtime: state's storage methods are RuntimeContext-colored,
 *       // so the reads/writes live here
 *       const count = (yield* state.storage.get<number>("count")) ?? 0;
 *
 *       return {
 *         increment: () =>
 *           Effect.gen(function* () {
 *             const next = count + 1;
 *             yield* state.storage.put("count", next);
 *             return next;
 *           }),
 *         get: () => Effect.succeed(count),
 *       };
 *     });
 *   }),
 * ) {}
 * ```
 *
 * @section Modular Durable Objects
 * When a Worker and a DO reference each other, or multiple Workers
 * bind the same DO, define the class separately from its `.make()`
 * call. The class is a lightweight identifier; `.make()` provides
 * the runtime implementation as an `export default`. Rolldown treats
 * `.make()` as pure, so the bundler tree-shakes it and all its
 * runtime dependencies out of any consumer's bundle.
 *
 * The class and `.make()` can live in the same file. This is the
 * same pattern used by `Worker` and `Container`.
 *
 * @example Modular Durable Object (class + .make() in one file)
 * ```typescript
 * // src/Counter.ts
 * export class Counter extends Cloudflare.DurableObject<Counter>()(
 *   "Counter",
 * ) {}
 *
 * export default Counter.make(
 *   Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     // init: bind resources + resolve the instance state ref
 *     const db = yield* Cloudflare.D1.QueryDatabase(MyDatabase);
 *     const state = yield* Cloudflare.DurableObjectState;
 *
 *     return Effect.gen(function* () {
 *       // runtime: state's storage methods are RuntimeContext-colored,
 *       // so the reads/writes live here
 *       const count = (yield* state.storage.get<number>("count")) ?? 0;
 *
 *       return {
 *         increment: () =>
 *           Effect.gen(function* () {
 *             const next = count + 1;
 *             yield* state.storage.put("count", next);
 *             yield* db.prepare("INSERT INTO logs (count) VALUES (?)").bind(next).run();
 *             return next;
 *           }),
 *         get: () => Effect.succeed(count),
 *       };
 *     });
 *   }),
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * @example Binding a modular DO from a Worker
 * ```typescript
 * // imports Counter; bundler tree-shakes .make()
 * import Counter from "./Counter.ts";
 *
 * // init
 * const counters = yield* Counter;
 *
 * return {
 *   fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     const counter = counters.getByName("user-123");
 *     return HttpServerResponse.text(String(yield* counter.get()));
 *   }),
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * @section Cross-Worker Binding
 * A Durable Object is _hosted_ by exactly one Worker, but any
 * number of other Workers can bind to the same DO. This is how
 * you share state across Workers: one Worker hosts the DO, every
 * other Worker addresses it by `scriptName` and gets a typed stub.
 *
 * To make this type-safe, the **host Worker** must declare the DO
 * as part of its public contract via the third type argument to
 * `Cloudflare.Worker<Self, Bindings, Deps>()`. `Deps` is the set
 * of DO classes (or other Workers) the script exposes for other
 * scripts to bind to.
 *
 * @example Host Worker declares the DO in its contract
 * ```typescript
 * // workerA.ts — hosts Counter
 * import { Counter, CounterLive } from "./object.ts";
 *
 * //                                       ^^^^^^^ declared as part of WorkerA's public contract
 * export class WorkerA extends Cloudflare.Worker<WorkerA, {}, Counter>()(
 *   "WorkerA",
 *   { main: import.meta.url },
 * ) {}
 *
 * // WorkerA's Layer also provides the DO's Live implementation.
 * export default WorkerA.make(
 *   Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     const counter = yield* Counter;
 *     return { fetch: Effect.gen(function* () { ... }) };
 *   }).pipe(Effect.provide(CounterLive)),
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * @example Consumer Worker binds the DO via `Counter.from(WorkerA)`
 * ```typescript
 * // workerB.ts — binds to the same Counter, hosted by WorkerA
 * import { Counter } from "./object.ts";
 * import { WorkerA } from "./workerA.ts";
 *
 * export default class WorkerB extends Cloudflare.Worker<WorkerB>()(
 *   "WorkerB",
 *   { main: import.meta.url },
 *   Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     //              ^^^^^^^^^^^^ scriptName-bound stub of WorkerA's Counter
 *     const counter = yield* Counter.from(WorkerA);
 *     return {
 *       fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
 *         const value = yield* counter.getByName("shared").get();
 *         return HttpServerResponse.text(String(value));
 *       }),
 *     };
 *   }),
 * ) {}
 * ```
 *
 * :::tip
 * The `, Counter` in `Worker<WorkerA, {}, Counter>` is what makes
 * `Counter.from(WorkerA)` type-check. You can still bind across
 * scripts without it (the runtime works either way), but consumers
 * will get a TypeScript error because `WorkerA` doesn't declare
 * `Counter` as part of its public contract.
 * :::
 *
 * Only the host Worker's Stack provides `CounterLive` — the
 * consumer Worker just imports the `Counter` class as a typed
 * identifier. Rolldown tree-shakes `CounterLive` (and its
 * dependencies) out of WorkerB's bundle.
 *
 * @section Using `.from(Self)` Inside the Host
 * Inside the host Worker, `yield* Counter` and
 * `yield* Counter.from(Self)` resolve to the same local namespace.
 * The `.from(Self)` form is preferred — especially in code that
 * may be extracted into a reusable Layer — because it makes the
 * scriptName explicit and lets the same Layer shape work whether
 * the consumer is the host or another script.
 *
 * @example `Counter.from(WorkerA)` inside WorkerA itself
 * ```typescript
 * // workerA.ts — host uses `.from(Self)` instead of bare `yield* Counter`
 * export default WorkerA.make(
 *   Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     const counter = yield* Counter.from(WorkerA); // same as `yield* Counter`
 *     return { fetch: Effect.gen(function* () { ... }) };
 *   }).pipe(Effect.provide(CounterLive)),
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * A Worker can also host its **own isolated** namespace this way.
 * If a second host Worker declares `Counter` in its contract and
 * provides `CounterLive`, the DO instances under that script are
 * separate from the original host's — same class, two namespaces.
 *
 * @example Two hosts, two isolated namespaces
 * ```typescript
 * // workerC.ts — another host of Counter, isolated from WorkerA
 * export class WorkerC extends Cloudflare.Worker<WorkerC, {}, Counter>()(
 *   "WorkerC",
 *   { main: import.meta.url },
 * ) {}
 *
 * export default WorkerC.make(
 *   Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     // .from(WorkerC) binds to WorkerC's own Counter namespace —
 *     // writes here are NOT visible from WorkerA's Counter.
 *     const counter = yield* Counter.from(WorkerC);
 *     return { fetch: Effect.gen(function* () { ... }) };
 *   }).pipe(Effect.provide(CounterLive)),
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * @section RPC Methods
 * Any function you return from the inner Effect becomes an RPC method
 * that Workers can call through a stub. Methods must return an `Effect`.
 * The caller gets a fully typed stub — if your DO returns `increment`
 * and `get`, the stub exposes `counter.increment()` and `counter.get()`.
 *
 * @example Defining RPC methods
 * ```typescript
 * return {
 *   increment: () => Effect.succeed(++count),
 *   get: () => Effect.succeed(count),
 *   reset: () => Effect.sync(() => { count = 0; }),
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * @section Returning Streams from RPC
 * RPC methods can return an Effect `Stream` and the caller will see
 * the chunks as they're produced. Combine with `Stream.schedule` to
 * pace emission, or with `Stream.fromQueue` to bridge an inbound
 * subscription.
 *
 * @example Streaming sequential numbers
 * ```typescript
 * import * as Schedule from "effect/Schedule";
 * import * as Stream from "effect/Stream";
 *
 * return {
 *   tick: (n: number) =>
 *     Stream.iterate(0, (i) => i + 1).pipe(
 *       Stream.take(n),
 *       Stream.schedule(Schedule.spaced("100 millis")),
 *     ),
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * @example Forwarding the stream as a chunked HTTP response
 * ```typescript
 * // in a Worker fetch handler
 * const counter = counters.getByName("tick");
 * const stream = counter.tick(5).pipe(
 *   Stream.map((i) => `${i}\n`),
 *   Stream.encodeText,
 * );
 * return HttpServerResponse.stream(stream, {
 *   headers: { "content-type": "text/plain" },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @section Worker → DO HTTP forwarding
 * In addition to RPC methods, the typed stub exposes a `fetch`
 * method that forwards an `HttpServerRequest` straight to the DO.
 * The DO's own `fetch` Effect produces the response — useful for
 * WebSocket upgrades and other request-shaped interactions.
 *
 * @example Forwarding an HTTP request to a DO
 * ```typescript
 * const room = rooms.getByName(roomId);
 * return yield* room.fetch(request);
 * ```
 *
 * @section Accessing Instance State
 * Each Durable Object instance has its own transactional key-value
 * storage via `Cloudflare.DurableObjectState`. Resolve the `state`
 * *reference* in the outer (init) Effect, but call its methods —
 * `storage.get`, `storage.put`, … — only from the inner (runtime)
 * Effect: those methods are `RuntimeContext`-colored, so the type
 * system only allows them inside the runtime closure.
 *
 * @example Reading and writing durable storage
 * ```typescript
 * // inner (runtime) Effect — `state` was resolved in the outer Effect
 * yield* state.storage.put("counter", 42);
 * const value = yield* state.storage.get("counter");
 * ```
 *
 * @section Background Work & Scopes
 * Every RPC call and fetch into a Durable Object gets its own Effect
 * `Scope`. When the method finishes, the bridge closes that scope and
 * registers the close promise with workerd's `state.waitUntil` — so
 * finalizers added with `Effect.addFinalizer` inside a method run *after*
 * the result is returned to the caller, without blocking it, and the
 * object stays alive until they settle.
 *
 * For ad-hoc background work, `state.waitUntil(effect)` forks an Effect
 * with the caller's full context and keeps the object alive until it
 * settles.
 *
 * Attach cleanup to method scopes, not the constructor (init) closure —
 * the constructor runs once per in-memory instance under
 * `blockConcurrencyWhile`, and its scope is not tied to any call.
 *
 * @example Responding before finishing the work
 * ```typescript
 * return {
 *   record: Effect.fn(function* (entry: string) {
 *     // runs after `record` returns; the DO stays alive until it settles
 *     yield* Effect.addFinalizer(() =>
 *       state.storage.put(`audit:${entry}`, Date.now()).pipe(Effect.ignore),
 *     );
 *     return "accepted" as const;
 *   }),
 *
 *   refresh: Effect.fn(function* () {
 *     // same idea, explicit form
 *     yield* state.waitUntil(recomputeExpensiveView());
 *     return "scheduled" as const;
 *   }),
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * @section WebSocket Hibernation
 * Durable Objects support WebSocket hibernation — the runtime can
 * evict the object from memory while keeping connections open. Use
 * `Cloudflare.upgrade()` to accept a connection, and return
 * `webSocketMessage` / `webSocketClose` handlers to process events
 * when the object wakes back up.
 *
 * @example Accepting a WebSocket connection
 * ```typescript
 * return {
 *   fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     const [response, socket] = yield* Cloudflare.upgrade();
 *     socket.serializeAttachment({ id: crypto.randomUUID() });
 *     return response;
 *   }),
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * @example Handling messages and close events
 * ```typescript
 * return {
 *   webSocketMessage: Effect.fn(function* (
 *     socket: Cloudflare.WebSocket,
 *     message: string | Uint8Array,
 *   ) {
 *     const text = typeof message === "string"
 *       ? message
 *       : new TextDecoder().decode(message);
 *     // process the message
 *   }),
 *   webSocketClose: Effect.fn(function* (
 *     ws: Cloudflare.WebSocket,
 *     code: number,
 *     reason: string,
 *   ) {
 *     yield* ws.close(code, reason);
 *   }),
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * @example Recovering sessions after hibernation
 * Resolve the `state` reference in the outer Effect, but place the
 * rehydration loop (`state.getWebSockets()` is `RuntimeContext`-colored)
 * **inside the inner `Effect.gen`** so it runs every time the DO
 * instance is reconstructed (including after Cloudflare wakes the DO
 * from hibernation).
 *
 * ```typescript
 * Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const state = yield* Cloudflare.DurableObjectState;
 *
 *   return Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     const sessions = new Map<string, Cloudflare.WebSocket>();
 *
 *     // Rehydrate the in-memory session map after hibernation.
 *     for (const socket of yield* state.getWebSockets()) {
 *       const data = socket.deserializeAttachment<{ id: string }>();
 *       if (data) sessions.set(data.id, socket);
 *     }
 *
 *     return {
 *       fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
 *         const [response, socket] = yield* Cloudflare.upgrade();
 *         const id = crypto.randomUUID();
 *         socket.serializeAttachment({ id });
 *         sessions.set(id, socket);
 *         return response;
 *       }),
 *       webSocketMessage: Effect.fn(function* (socket, message) {
 *         const text =
 *           typeof message === "string" ? message : new TextDecoder().decode(message);
 *         for (const peer of sessions.values()) {
 *           yield* peer.send(text);
 *         }
 *       }),
 *     };
 *   });
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @section Scheduled Alarms
 * Each Durable Object can have a single alarm timestamp. Alchemy
 * layers a small SQLite-backed scheduler on top via
 * `Cloudflare.Workers.scheduleEvent` and `Cloudflare.Workers.processScheduledEvents`,
 * so you can register many named events with arbitrary payloads and
 * fire them from a single `alarm` handler.
 *
 * @example Scheduling and processing events
 * ```typescript
 * // schedule from a request or message handler
 * yield* Cloudflare.Workers.scheduleEvent(
 *   "reminder-1",
 *   new Date(Date.now() + 60_000),
 *   { message: "your meeting starts in a minute" },
 * );
 *
 * return {
 *   alarm: () =>
 *     Effect.gen(function* () {
 *       const fired = yield* Cloudflare.Workers.processScheduledEvents;
 *       for (const event of fired) {
 *         const payload = event.payload as { message: string };
 *         // dispatch / broadcast / persist...
 *       }
 *     }),
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * @section Using from a Worker
 * Yield the DO class in your Worker's init phase to get a namespace
 * handle. Call `getByName` or `getById` to get a typed stub, then
 * call any RPC method or forward an HTTP request with `fetch`.
 *
 * @example Calling RPC methods
 * ```typescript
 * // init
 * const counters = yield* Counter;
 *
 * return {
 *   fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     const counter = counters.getByName("user-123");
 *     yield* counter.increment();
 *     const value = yield* counter.get();
 *     return HttpServerResponse.text(String(value));
 *   }),
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * @example Forwarding an HTTP request
 * ```typescript
 * // init
 * const rooms = yield* Room;
 *
 * return {
 *   fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     const request = yield* HttpServerRequest;
 *     const room = rooms.getByName(roomId);
 *     return yield* room.fetch(request);
 *   }),
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * @section Binding in an Async Worker
 * When using an Async Worker (plain `async fetch` handler, no Effect
 * runtime), declare Durable Objects in the `bindings` prop of the
 * Worker resource. Pass a `DurableObject` reference with a
 * `className` matching the exported `DurableObject` subclass in your
 * worker source file. If `className` is omitted, it defaults to the
 * namespace name. Use `Cloudflare.InferEnv` to get a fully typed
 * `env` object that includes the namespace.
 *
 * @example Declaring a DO binding in the stack
 * ```typescript
 * // alchemy.run.ts
 * import type { Counter } from "./src/worker.ts";
 *
 * export type WorkerEnv = Cloudflare.InferEnv<typeof Worker>;
 *
 * export const Worker = Cloudflare.Worker("Worker", {
 *   main: "./src/worker.ts",
 *   bindings: {
 *     Counter: Cloudflare.DurableObject<Counter>("Counter"),
 *   },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example Using the DO from a plain async handler
 * ```typescript
 * // src/worker.ts
 * import { DurableObject } from "cloudflare:workers";
 * import type { WorkerEnv } from "../alchemy.run.ts";
 *
 * export default {
 *   async fetch(request: Request, env: WorkerEnv) {
 *     const counter = env.Counter.getByName("my-counter");
 *     const count = await counter.increment();
 *     return new Response(JSON.stringify({ count }));
 *   },
 * };
 *
 * export class Counter extends DurableObject {
 *   private counter = 0;
 *   async increment() {
 *     return ++this.counter;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @section Cross-Script Binding in an Async Worker
 * Async Workers can also bind to a Durable Object hosted by another
 * Worker script. The host Worker declares and exports the DO class. The
 * consumer Worker declares a `DurableObject` with `scriptName`
 * set to the host Worker's script name.
 *
 * Cross-script async bindings are references only: the consumer uploads
 * the binding metadata, but Alchemy does not drive class migrations for
 * the foreign class. Deploy the host first so Cloudflare can verify that
 * the target script exports the requested class.
 *
 * @example Host Worker owns the Durable Object class
 * ```typescript
 * const host = yield* Cloudflare.Worker("Host", {
 *   main: "./src/host.ts",
 *   bindings: {
 *     Counter: Cloudflare.DurableObject<Counter>("Counter"),
 *   },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example Consumer Worker binds to the host script
 * ```typescript
 * const consumer = yield* Cloudflare.Worker("Consumer", {
 *   main: "./src/consumer.ts",
 *   bindings: {
 *     Counter: Cloudflare.DurableObject<Counter>("Counter", {
 *       scriptName: host.workerName,
 *     }),
 *   },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example Binding to a different exported class name
 * ```typescript
 * const consumer = yield* Cloudflare.Worker("Consumer", {
 *   main: "./src/consumer.ts",
 *   bindings: {
 *     Counter: Cloudflare.DurableObject<Counter>("Counter", {
 *       className: "CounterV2",
 *       scriptName: host.workerName,
 *     }),
 *   },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @section Adopting an Existing Durable Object
 * When you adopt a Worker that already exists on Cloudflare — created
 * outside Alchemy via Wrangler, the dashboard, or the raw API — its
 * Durable Object classes are adopted along with it. You opt in to the
 * takeover the same way you adopt any foreign resource: with
 * `adopt(true)` (or the `--adopt` CLI flag), since `Worker.read` reports
 * a worker with no Alchemy ownership tags as `Unowned`.
 *
 * Alchemy normally tracks which class backs each binding through an
 * `alchemy:do:<logicalId>:<className>` tag it writes on the script. A
 * foreign worker has no such tag, so on the **adopting deploy** Alchemy
 * falls back to matching your binding to the live class **by binding
 * name**. The class is then reused in place — not recreated — so
 * Cloudflare's migration engine doesn't reject the upload for creating a
 * class that already exists.
 *
 * The consequence is a one-time constraint: **on the adopting deploy the
 * binding's `className` must match the class that already exists on the
 * worker.** You cannot rename the class in the same deploy that adopts
 * it. Once the deploy completes, Alchemy owns the worker and has written
 * the `alchemy:do:` tag, so subsequent renames are driven by logical id
 * and work normally.
 *
 * @example Adopting a worker whose `Counter` class already exists
 * ```typescript
 * // The worker + `Counter` class were created outside Alchemy.
 * // `className` must match the existing class on this first deploy.
 * const worker = yield* Cloudflare.Worker("Worker", {
 *   name: "existing-worker",
 *   main: "./src/worker.ts",
 *   bindings: {
 *     Counter: Cloudflare.DurableObject<Counter>("Counter"),
 *   },
 * }).pipe(adopt(true));
 * ```
 *
 * @example Renaming the class — only after adoption
 * ```typescript
 * // A SECOND deploy, after the one above. Alchemy now owns the worker
 * // and maps the binding by logical id, so the class can be renamed.
 * const worker = yield* Cloudflare.Worker("Worker", {
 *   name: "existing-worker",
 *   main: "./src/worker.ts",
 *   bindings: {
 *     Counter: Cloudflare.DurableObject<Counter>("Counter", {
 *       className: "CounterV2",
 *     }),
 *   },
 * });
 * ```
