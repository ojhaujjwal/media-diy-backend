 * The Effect worker bridge builds its layer stack once per isolate and shares

 * created under another event's request context is only sound with workerd's
 * corrected cross-request promise semantics (default-on since compatibility
 * date 2024-10-14): continuations are scheduled back into the promise's
 * origin context instead of running in whichever request happens to resolve
 * them. A user pinning an older compatibility date must not silently revert
 * the bridge to the broken semantics, so the flag is forced for
 * alchemy-bundled workers — and explicitly disabling it is a deploy-time
 * error.
