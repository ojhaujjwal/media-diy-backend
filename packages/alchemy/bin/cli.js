#!/usr/bin/env node
// alchemy CLI launcher
//
// Resolves the alchemy CLI entrypoint via node module resolution and execs it
// under whichever runtime the user invoked us with. The shebang forces this
// launcher to run as node even when bun was the invoker, but bun forwards
// signals about itself via env vars on every child it spawns:
//
//   - `npm_execpath`           → path to bun (set for `bun run <script>`)
//   - `npm_config_user_agent`  → "bun/<version> ..." (set for `bun run`,
//                                `bunx`, and direct bun-launched bins)
//
// Either signal is enough to know bun is the outer runtime.
//
// Dev vs published: when this launcher runs out of an alchemy checkout
// (i.e. *not* from inside a `node_modules/` tree) and bun is available, we
// run the .ts source directly so dev iteration is edit → reload, no rebuild.
// The published tarball ships the .ts files as well (alchemy's `bun`/`worker`
// exports point at .ts source), but consumers install into `node_modules/`,
// so the path check sends them to the bundled `alchemy.js` regardless.
//
// We use @alchemy.run/node-utils' foreground-child so we can pipe the
// child's stderr through a filter — upstream hardcodes stdio = [0, 1, 2],
// so the only way to drop bun's hard-coded watcher warning ("warn: File
// <path> is not in the project directory and will not be watched", which is
// noise in our monorepo and has no bun flag to silence) is to own the spawn
// call. Everything else — signal proxying, watchdog, IPC bridging, exit-code
// forwarding — matches upstream.
