/**
 * The `Clock` module provides functionality for time-based operations in Effect applications.
 * It offers precise time measurements, scheduling capabilities, and controlled time management
 * for testing scenarios.
 *
 * The Clock service is a core component of the Effect runtime, providing:
 * - Current time access in milliseconds and nanoseconds
 * - Sleep operations for delaying execution
 * - Time-based scheduling primitives
 * - Testable time control through `TestClock`
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * - **Precise timing**: Access to both millisecond and nanosecond precision
 * - **Sleep operations**: Non-blocking sleep with proper interruption handling
 * - **Service integration**: Seamless integration with Effect's dependency injection
 * - **Testable**: Mock time control for deterministic testing
 * - **Resource-safe**: Automatic cleanup of time-based resources
 *
 * **Example** (Measuring elapsed time)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Clock, Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * // Get current time in milliseconds
 * const getCurrentTime = Clock.currentTimeMillis
 *
 * // Sleep for 1 second
 * const sleep1Second = Effect.sleep("1 seconds")
 *
 * // Measure execution time
 * const measureTime = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   const start = yield* Clock.currentTimeMillis
 *   yield* Effect.sleep("100 millis")
 *   const end = yield* Clock.currentTimeMillis
 *   return end - start
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * **Example** (Using the Clock service)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Clock, Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * // Using Clock service directly
 * const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   const clock = yield* Clock.Clock
 *   const currentTime = yield* clock.currentTimeMillis
 *   console.log(`Current time: ${currentTime}`)
 *
 *   // Sleep for 500ms
 *   yield* Effect.sleep("500 millis")
 *
 *   const afterSleep = yield* clock.currentTimeMillis
 *   console.log(`After sleep: ${afterSleep}`)
 * })
 * ```
