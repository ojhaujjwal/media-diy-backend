/**
 * Track provider response IDs for incremental language model calls.
 *
 * Some providers can continue from a prior response by accepting a
 * `previousResponseId` plus only the messages added after that response. This
 * module exposes a small mutable service that remembers which prompt message
 * objects were included in each provider response and prepares a shorter prompt
 * when a later call extends the same conversation.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * The tracker is an optimization cache, not conversation storage. `markParts`
 * associates the exact message objects that were sent with the response ID the
 * provider returned. `prepareUnsafe` scans a future prompt, finds the latest
 * assistant-message boundary whose prefix is tracked, and returns that response
 * ID with only the messages after the boundary. If the prompt cannot be matched
 * safely, the cache is cleared and no incremental send is attempted.
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Provide `ResponseIdTracker` to a language model implementation that can use
 *   provider previous-response IDs
 * - Mark prompt messages after a successful provider response
 * - Prepare follow-up prompts so unchanged history is replaced by
 *   `previousResponseId`
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - Tracking is based on object identity; equivalent message values are not
 *   recognized unless they are the same objects.
 * - The service is mutable and intentionally exposes `Unsafe` methods because
 *   callers coordinate it inside provider request/response code.
 * - A mismatch clears tracked state to avoid reusing a response ID for the
 *   wrong prompt prefix.
