/**
 * The `ClusterMetrics` module defines the standard metrics emitted by the
 * unstable cluster runtime. These gauges track the shape and health of a
 * running cluster from the perspective of runners, entities, singletons, and
 * shard ownership.
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Monitor how many entity instances and singleton processes are active on a
 *   runner
 * - Track registered runners and the subset currently considered healthy
 * - Observe shard distribution across runners during startup, rebalancing, and
 *   failover
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - Runner-local gauges such as {@link entities}, {@link singletons}, and
 *   {@link shards} describe the current runner, so aggregate them carefully in
 *   dashboards
 * - Cluster-wide gauges such as {@link runners} and {@link runnersHealthy}
 *   reflect the runtime's current view, which may lag briefly during membership
 *   changes or failure detection
 *
 * @since 4.0.0

 * **When to use**

 * type for cluster dashboards.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * Bigint gauge named `effect_cluster_entities`, updated with the entity type as
 * a metric tag.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * This gauge is runner-local and sampled by the entity manager loop. Aggregate
 * across runners and expect up to roughly one polling interval of lag.
