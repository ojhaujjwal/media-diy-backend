/**
 * Client-side protocol failures reported by unstable RPC transports.
 *
 * `RpcClientError` is the error type generated clients use when a call fails
 * before a remote handler can return its declared typed error. Its `reason`
 * covers built-in transport failures from HTTP, sockets, and workers, plus
 * `RpcClientDefect` values for malformed or incompatible protocol data.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * Handler errors belong to the RPC's declared error schema and are decoded from
 * the response exit. Client errors describe the client or transport boundary:
 * unavailable transport, aborted connections, unreadable response bodies,
 * failed response decoding, or protocol shapes that do not match the RPC group
 * the client was built for. Treat them as infrastructure or compatibility
 * failures rather than business-domain failures.
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * Inspect `error.reason._tag` to decide whether to retry, reconnect, report a
 * transport issue, or surface a schema or codec mismatch. Custom protocols can
 * use `RpcClientDefect` to put invalid client-side protocol state in the same
 * public error channel used by the built-in transports.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * Server defects are sent through protocol messages and normally fail the call
 * as defects rather than as declared RPC errors. Serialization and schema
 * decode failures can appear as client defects because the client cannot safely
 * produce the typed success or error value promised by the RPC definition.
