/**
 * The `Resource` module provides refreshable, scoped values. A
 * `Resource<A, E>` stores the latest successful or failed acquisition result and
 * can be read with {@link get}, refreshed manually with {@link refresh}, or
 * refreshed automatically with {@link auto}.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - A `Resource` wraps an acquisition `Effect` whose result is kept in a
 *   `ScopedRef`
 * - Each refresh re-runs acquisition and replaces the stored `Exit`
 * - Replacing the stored value releases resources associated with the previous
 *   scoped value
 * - Reading a resource returns the current acquired value or fails with the
 *   current acquisition error
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Create a manually refreshed resource with {@link manual}
 * - Create a schedule-driven resource with {@link auto}
 * - Read the current value with {@link get}
 * - Force a reload with {@link refresh}
 * - Check whether an unknown value is a resource with {@link isResource}
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - Creating a resource requires a `Scope`; when the scope closes, scoped
 *   values held by the resource are released
 * - Failed acquisitions are stored too, so subsequent {@link get} calls fail
 *   until a refresh succeeds
 * - Automatic refreshes run in the resource scope and stop when that scope is
 *   closed
